# Google Drive OAuth 2.0 Integration Configuration

## 🎯 **Key Difference: OAuth 2.0 vs Service Account**

**Service Account (Old Way):**
- ❌ All files go into one Google Drive (yours)
- ❌ Shared programmatically
- ❌ Uses your storage quota

**OAuth 2.0 (New Way):**
- ✅ Each user authenticates with their own Google account
- ✅ Files go directly into their own Google Drive
- ✅ Uses their own storage quota
- ✅ More professional and secure

## 🚀 **Setup Steps:**

### **1. Create Google Cloud Project**
1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Create a new project or select existing one
3. Enable **Google Drive API** and **Google+ API**

### **2. Configure OAuth Consent Screen**
1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "OAuth consent screen"
2. Choose **External** (for public use)
3. Fill in app name, support email, and domain info
4. Under **Scopes**, add:
   ```
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.file
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.email
   https://www.googleapis.com/auth/userinfo.profile
   ```
5. Add test users (if in testing mode)

### **3. Create OAuth 2.0 Client**
1. Go to "APIs & Services" → "Credentials"
2. Click "Create Credentials" → "OAuth client ID"
3. Choose **Web Application** type
4. Add Authorized redirect URIs:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/files/auth/google/callback
   https://yourapp.com/files/auth/google/callback
   ```
5. Save the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**

### **4. Set Environment Variables**
Add these to your `.env` file:

```env
# Google OAuth 2.0
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID="your-oauth-client-id"
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET="your-oauth-client-secret"
GOOGLE_REDIRECT_URI="http://localhost:3000/files/auth/google/callback"
```

### **5. Install Dependencies**
```bash
cd backend
npm install googleapis
```

## 🔄 **How It Works:**

### **Step 1: User Authorization**
1. User clicks "Connect Google Drive"
2. Redirected to Google's consent page
3. User grants permission to access their Drive
4. Google returns authorization code

### **Step 2: Token Exchange**
1. Backend exchanges code for access/refresh tokens
2. Tokens stored in user's session/database
3. User can now upload files to their own Drive

### **Step 3: File Operations**
1. All file operations use user's tokens
2. Files go directly into user's Google Drive
3. No shared storage or service account needed

## 📱 **User Experience Flow:**

```
User → Click "Connect Google Drive" → Google Consent → Grant Permission → 
Backend gets tokens → User uploads files → Files go to THEIR Drive
```

## 🔒 **Security Features:**

- **User Isolation**: Each user only accesses their own Drive
- **Token Management**: Secure token storage and refresh
- **Permission Scopes**: Minimal required permissions
- **No Shared Storage**: Complete user data isolation
